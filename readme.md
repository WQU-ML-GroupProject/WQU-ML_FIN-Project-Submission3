# Project Title
WQU-ML_FIN-Project-Submission3/submission3.ipynb

Using dollar bars of Bitcoin data from the Bitstamp exchange, a trading strategy was created that would take long and short positions on the basis of momentum and driven by technical indicators such exponential moving average, relative strength index, and commodity channel index.  The model is then fitted using decision tree, random forest, logistic regression, and support vector machine.  Each model is then tuned and evaluated for accuracy and robustness.  Finally, return and risk metrics are generated for the trading system to quantify expectations and to evaluate if the system should be used. 

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them

pip install pandas
pip install matplotlib
pip install seaborn
pip install scipy
pip install statsmodels
pip install mpl_finance
pip install sklearn


```
Give examples
```

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running

Say what the step will be

```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo

## Running the tests

Explain how to run the automated tests for this system

### Break down into end to end tests
